# **WeRateDogs Data Wrangling**

This project started as an assessment for for the **Udacity Data Analysis Professional Track**.

The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because ["they're good dogs Brent."](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent) WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
